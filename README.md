Tap Herder Game

Tap Herder
Yeah, it’s a shitty name, but that’s what I have right now.

Concept
This is a simple puzzle game in which the player attempts to optimize their points by “saving” a variety of creatures by guiding them to a destination without them being destroyed by a variety of obstacles.
Gameplay is on a hexagonal board, with each hex potentially being an empty (safe) space, an obstacle, or hazard.  The player clicks on a hex in the game board, and the creatures behave according to their creature type (in the simplest example, by fleeing 1 space from the source of the tap).

The goal of the game is to optimize points by taking the fewest possible clicks to save the most creatures.  A game instance (“board” or “level”) ends when all creatures are either saved or destroyed.
